<h1> A brief description </h1>
<p>
  Every developer and designer should be able to guess by intuition a certain color by just looking at its RGB value. That's the purpose of the game. You will see an RGB value and a number of colors depending on the difficulty, your objective is to guess the color using the minimal number of guesses.
</p>
<h1> Modes </h1>
<ol>
  <li><p><strong>Hard Mode:</strong> 6 colors to guess from making it slightly difficult to guess on the first try.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Easy Mode:</strong> 3 colors to guess, quite easy to win at the first try (most of the times)</p></li>  
</ol>

<h1>Purpose</h1>

<p> The RGB Color Guesssing game will aid you have a better understanding of the RGB color system. Through practice, your intuiting will be sharpened making you capable of doing speedy guesses by just reading the RGB values. </p>

<h1> Future changes </h1>
<p>In the future, I'll migrate the code to a framework (maybe Bootstrap) to use its grid system instead of floats (and modify a bit the aesthetics of the site while I am there)</p>
<p>Will also modify the game to have a limited number of guesses depending of the difficulty.</p>
<p>Make a extremely difficult game variation which takes account the opacity of the color as well (RGBa) </p>
